# Game of Life

_Written in Python 3, I won't guarantee that the project works with Python 2._

Little Python project written with [this](https://robertheaton.com/2018/07/20/project-2-game-of-life/) tutorial by Robert Heaton as a guideline (no code copypasting). Project also serves as a practice to write clean and tested code.

Project is currently on hold and I might some day continue with it. So this repo in Github serves mostly as a backup for the code.
